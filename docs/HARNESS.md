# Engineering Harness — oh-my-harness-loop

**Stack:** TypeScript, Vitest, OpenCode Plugin API (`@opencode-ai/plugin`)  
**Published:** npm `oh-my-harness-loop` · GitHub `nano-step/oh-my-harness-loop`

## Lanes

| Lane | Risk flags | Flow |
|------|-----------|------|
| **tiny** | 0–1 | Direct patch → validate → PR |
| **normal** | 2–3 | OpenSpec proposal → implement → validate → PR |
| **high-risk** | 4+ OR hard gate | deep-design → OpenSpec → implement → review gate → PR |

### Hard gates (auto → high-risk lane)

- `public-api-contract` — changes to exported types, `RunnerOutputSchema`, `HarnessConfigSchema`
- `plugin-api-compat` — changes to `@opencode-ai/plugin` event hooks or command signatures
- `npm-publish-contract` — changes to `package.json` `exports`, `main`, `types`, `files`

---

## Validation Ladder

| Layer | Command | Required for |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `validate:quick` | `tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run` | every lane |
| `self-review:staged-files` | `git status` — no unintended files | every lane |
| `self-review:types` | No `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error` | every lane |
| `test:integration` | `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose` | normal + high-risk |
| `smoke:publish` | `npm pack --dry-run` — no missing files | normal + high-risk |
| `test:release` | `node dist/index.js` (or import check) | before publish |

### Change types vs gates

| Type | smoke:publish | Review gate |
|------|:---:|:---:|
| user-feature | ✅ | ✅ |
| bug-fix | ✅ | ✅ |
| refactor | ❌ | ⚠️ self-verify |
| infrastructure | ❌ | ⚠️ self-verify |
| docs | ❌ | ❌ |
| dependency-bump | ❌ | ⚠️ self-verify |

## Flow

```
① Create GitHub issue (before any code)
② Classify lane + change type → label issue
③ tiny → patch direct
   normal/high-risk → /opsx-propose → OpenSpec change
④ [high-risk] deep-design gap analysis (Metis + Oracle) → revise until clean
⑤ Implement → run validation ladder
⑥ [user-feature / bug-fix] npm pack --dry-run check
⑦ Review gate → PR → merge → auto-tag → npm publish
⑧ openspec archive
```

### Gate lifecycle

```
① PRE-WORK → ② IN-PROGRESS → ③ PRE-MERGE → ④ POST-MERGE → ⑤ NEXT-READY
```

All gates must PASS before proceeding.

## Release Pipeline

| Trigger | Workflow | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `master` push | `auto-tag.yml` | Compute tag `v{YYYY}.{M}.{DDNN}` → push |
| `v*` tag | `release.yml` | Build dist → GitHub Release → `npm publish` |

**Skip release:** add `[skip-release]` to commit subject.

---

## Auto-merge Policy

Agents may auto-merge their own PR (`gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) without asking the user **when ALL of the following hold**:

1. **Lane is `tiny` or `normal`.** High-risk lane PRs always require user merge approval.
2. **Pre-merge gate PASSed** — full validation ladder green: `tsc --noEmit`, `vitest run`, no forbidden type escapes, `npm pack --dry-run`.
3. **E2E smoke test verified the user-facing behavior change** — not just unit tests. For example:
   - For a CLI/script change: run the script with realistic inputs in a tmpdir and assert the observable side-effects.
   - For a plugin behavior change: spawn an opencode session and probe the changed behavior (`opencode run --format json …`, see global AGENTS.md "E2E Behavior Verification" rule).
   - For a config/types change: run a consumer scenario end-to-end with the new build.
   - Unit tests alone do NOT satisfy this requirement — they prove the code does what the tests say, not that the user's problem is solved.
4. **CI on the PR is green.** Wait for `gh pr checks <n>` to report `pass` before merging.
5. **No conflicts, no requested reviewers.** `gh pr view --json mergeable,reviewRequests` shows `MERGEABLE` and empty review requests.
6. **Smoke evidence is preserved in the PR description.** Paste the smoke-test commands and output so reviewers can reproduce.

When all 6 hold: merge and continue with post-merge / next-ready gates without pausing. Report the merge SHA and release tag in the final summary.

When ANY of them fails: **PAUSE** at "awaiting user merge approval". Surface which precondition failed and what evidence is missing.

**Hard exceptions** (always pause regardless of the 6 above):
- PR touches `RunnerOutputSchema`, `HarnessConfigSchema`, or any exported public type → hard gate `public-api-contract`.
- PR touches `package.json` `exports`, `main`, `types`, or `files` → hard gate `npm-publish-contract`.
- PR introduces a new runtime dependency.
- Release pipeline is currently broken (red on master). Fix it first.

The `[skip-release]` suffix in commit messages is **NOT** a substitute for these checks — it only controls auto-tag; merging still triggers history rewrite + branch deletion.

## Epic Mode

Available since v306. Activates **autonomous multi-story execution**: one `/harness-on --epic` invocation drives every story in a backlog through the full gate cycle until the queue is drained or a story fails.

### When to use

- BMAD has produced N stories across M epics and you want hands-off shipping
- You have a backlog file (`.opencode/harness.epic.json`) or want to consume from another source
- All stories follow the same gate cycle (single config)

### Activation

Add an `epic` block to `harness.config.json`:

```json
{
  "epic": {
    "backlog_source": "file",
    "backlog_file": ".opencode/harness.epic.json",
    "failure_policy": "ask",
    "max_iterations_per_epic": 500
  }
}
```

Run `/harness-on --epic` (or `/harness-on --epic=./custom-backlog.json`).

### Interaction with Auto-merge Policy

Each story PR is governed by the **same** 6-precondition Auto-merge Policy. There is no "epic-wide" auto-merge — every PR earns its merge independently. If a PR fails any precondition, the epic pauses (per `failure_policy: "ask"`) and waits for `/harness-on --epic --resume`.

### `/harness-off` in epic context

- `/harness-off` — preserves epic state (`loop.epic` block stays). Resume via `/harness-on --epic --resume`.
- `/harness-off --clean` — full wipe (legacy v305 behavior).

### Iteration caps

Three counters protect against runaway cost:

| Counter | Default | Resets when |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_iterations_per_gate` | 10 | New story starts (per-story reset) |
| `max_total_iterations` | 100 | Never (loop lifetime — but resets via `/harness-off`) |
| `max_iterations_per_epic` | 500 | New epic starts |

Failure policy `ask` pauses the epic when any cap is hit.

### Out of scope (Phase 2+)

- GitHub Issues / Projects v2 adapters (Phase 2)
- `failure_policy: "skip" | "abort"` (Phase 2)
- Parallel stories via worktrees (Phase 3)
- `/harness-status`, `/harness-skip`, `/harness-retry` commands (Phase 2)

---

## Forbidden Practices

- No `as any`, `@ts-ignore` — type errors must be fixed
- No committing directly to `master` — always branch + PR
- No claiming "tests pass" without output
- No publishing without `npm pack --dry-run` passing
- No archiving OpenSpec change without review verdict PASS
- No breaking `RunnerOutputSchema` or `HarnessConfigSchema` without a `public-api-contract` issue
- No auto-merging when any auto-merge precondition fails (see Auto-merge Policy above)
