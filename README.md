# Harness Loop Plugin

Autonomous gate-driven development workflow plugin for OpenCode.

## What It Does

The harness loop plugin automates your development workflow by driving your project through configured gates (build, test, lint, etc.) until all pass or a hard-stop condition triggers. It hooks into OpenCode's `session.idle` event to continuously re-check gates and inject continuation prompts when fixes are needed.

## Quick Start

**Fastest path:** ask your AI agent in OpenCode:

```
setup harness-on
```

The agent reads [`docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENT.md`](docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENT.md) and walks through the setup for you.

**Manual path** (5 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install oh-my-harness-loop@latest

# 2. Register in opencode.json
mkdir -p .opencode
echo '{"plugin":["oh-my-harness-loop@latest"]}' > .opencode/opencode.json

# 3. Copy templates (config + runner stub + gate docs + .gitignore)
cp node_modules/oh-my-harness-loop/templates/init/.opencode/harness.config.json .opencode/
mkdir -p scripts && cp node_modules/oh-my-harness-loop/templates/init/scripts/harness-check.sh scripts/
chmod +x scripts/harness-check.sh
mkdir -p docs/harness/gates && cp node_modules/oh-my-harness-loop/templates/init/docs/harness/gates/*.md docs/harness/gates/
cat node_modules/oh-my-harness-loop/templates/init/gitignore.template >> .gitignore

# 4. Sanity check
./scripts/harness-check.sh pre-work --json

# 5. Restart OpenCode, then run:
#    /harness-on
```

**Full walkthrough with troubleshooting:** [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)

The templates ship with a **no-op stub runner** (every gate returns PASS). Edit `scripts/harness-check.sh` and `docs/harness/gates/*.md` to wire your real checks (tsc, vitest, lint, etc.).

## Slash Commands (auto-installed)

When you `npm install oh-my-harness-loop` in a project, a `postinstall` script automatically creates the OpenCode slash-command shims:

- `.opencode/commands/harness-on.md`
- `.opencode/commands/harness-off.md`

These shims make `/harness-on` and `/harness-off` appear in OpenCode's autocomplete. The plugin intercepts the commands at runtime via the `command.execute.before` hook.

**The postinstall:**
- Never overwrites existing files — if you customize the shims, they're preserved.
- Fails silently — install never breaks even if shim creation errors.
- Can be disabled: set `OH_MY_HARNESS_LOOP_SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1` before installing.

If you skip the postinstall (or it failed), create the shims manually:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/commands
cat > .opencode/commands/harness-on.md <<'EOF'
---
description: Start the harness gate loop for the current feature
---

$ARGUMENTS
EOF

cat > .opencode/commands/harness-off.md <<'EOF'
---
description: Cancel the active harness gate loop
---
EOF
```

Then restart OpenCode for the commands to appear in autocomplete.

## Configuration Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `runner_path` | string | **required** | Path to runner script (relative to project root) |

| `fail_policy` | "auto" \| "hybrid" \| "ask" | "hybrid" | How to handle failures |
| `rule_id_format` | string | `"{id}"` | Format string for rule IDs (e.g., `"R{id}"`, `"FP #{id}"`) |
| `max_total_iterations` | number | 100 | Hard cap on total iterations across all gates |

### Gate Instructions

Point each gate to project-specific documentation and skills:

```json
{
  "gate_instructions": {
    "pre-merge": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/pre-merge.md",
      "skills": ["review-work"]
    },
    "smoke-e2e": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/smoke-e2e.md",
      "skills": ["playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

If `doc` is omitted, the plugin tries `docs/harness/gates/<gate>.md` by convention.

### Async Gates

For gates that depend on external systems (CI, deploys, npm publish):

```json
{
  "gate_instructions": {
    "post-merge-npm-release": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/post-merge-npm-release.md",
      "async": true,
      "async_max_wait_seconds": 1800,
      "async_poll_interval_seconds": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## Runner Contract

Your runner must:

1. Accept `<gate-name> [--feature=<id>] [--force] [--json]` as arguments
2. Output exactly one JSON object to stdout
3. Exit with code matching status (0=PASS, 1=FAIL, 2=SKIP, 3=WAITING, 4=BLOCKED, 5=ERROR)

### Output Schema

```json
{
  "gate": "pre-work",
  "status": "PASS | FAIL | SKIP | WAITING | BLOCKED | ERROR",
  "checks": [
    { "id": "1.1", "name": "Issue exists", "status": "PASS", "rule_id": "R89" }
  ],
  "next_gate": "in-progress",
  "instructions_for_agent": "Required when status is FAIL or BLOCKED",
  "wait_seconds": 60,
  "rule_ids_violated": ["R29", "R31"]
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/harness-on` | Start the harness loop. If a loop is already active, emits an error telling you to use `--resume` or `--restart`. |
| `/harness-on --resume` | Rebind an existing loop into the current session. Re-runs the current gate from iteration 0 (gates are idempotent). |
| `/harness-on --restart` | Wipe existing state and start fresh from the first gate. |
| `/harness-on --force` | Start fresh, ignoring cached gate results. |
| `/harness-on --epic [path]` | Start epic mode. See [Epic Mode](#epic-mode-v306). |
| `/harness-on --epic --resume` | Resume preserved epic at the current story. |
| `/harness-off` | Stop the active loop. Preserves epic state for `--resume`. |
| `/harness-off --clean` | Stop and wipe all state, including epic. |

## How to Adopt in Your Project

1. **Copy the plugin directory** into your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r .opencode/plugin/harness-loop <your-project>/.opencode/plugin/
   ```

2. **Install and build:**
   ```bash
   cd <your-project>/.opencode/plugin/harness-loop
   npm install && npm run build
   cd ../../..
   ```

3. **Create `.opencode/harness.config.json`** (minimal example):
   ```json
   {
     "runner_path": "./scripts/harness-check.sh",
     "gates": ["pre-work", "in-progress", "pre-merge"],
     "fail_policy": "hybrid"
   }
   ```

4. **Write or adapt a runner script** that accepts `<gate> [--json]` and outputs the runner contract JSON.

5. **Start the loop:**
   ```
   /harness-on
   ```

## Override Mechanism

Two mechanisms let you pause the loop when automatic fixing isn't possible:

**Agent token** — add this anywhere in the agent's reply:
```
[HARNESS-OVERRIDE]: <reason for human intervention>
```
The loop pauses and waits for user approval before continuing.

**File override** — create `.opencode/harness.override.json` before running `/harness-on`:
```json
{
  "max_iterations_per_gate": 20,
  "skip_gates": ["e2e"]
}
```
The config is merged once at loop start and the file is auto-deleted when the loop ends.

## Epic Mode (v306+)

Drive every story in a multi-story backlog through the gate cycle with a single `/harness-on --epic` invocation. The plugin advances stories automatically, pauses on failure for operator input (`ask` policy), and persists progress for `--resume`.

### Backlog file schema

`.opencode/harness.epic.json`:

```json
{
  "epic_id": "EPIC-24",
  "title": "Postgres migration",
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "STORY-24-0",
      "title": "PG governance setup",
      "feature_id": "feat/24-0-pg-governance",
      "issue_number": 240,
      "story": "Set up governance for the Postgres migration ...",
      "depends_on": []
    },
    {
      "id": "STORY-24-1",
      "title": "PG Alembic baseline",
      "feature_id": "feat/24-1-pg-alembic-baseline",
      "depends_on": ["STORY-24-0"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Required fields: `id`, `title`. Optional: `feature_id`, `issue_number`, `story`, `depends_on` (defaults to `[]`).

### Config

Add to `harness.config.json`:

```json
{
  "epic": {
    "backlog_source": "file",
    "backlog_file": ".opencode/harness.epic.json",
    "failure_policy": "ask",
    "max_iterations_per_epic": 500
  }
}
```

The `epic` block is **optional**. Without it, single-story mode works exactly as v305.

### Usage

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/harness-on` | Single-story mode (unchanged) |
| `/harness-on --epic` | Epic mode, default backlog from config |
| `/harness-on --epic=<path>` | Epic mode, custom backlog file |
| `/harness-on --epic --resume` | Resume from preserved epic state |
| `/harness-off` | Preserve epic state (resume-able) |
| `/harness-off --clean` | Full wipe (legacy v305 behavior) |

### Story dependencies

`depends_on` is an array of story IDs that must complete before this story is eligible. The plugin topo-sorts at start; cycles and missing references fail loud.

### Failure handling

Phase 1 supports only `failure_policy: "ask"` — when any story exhausts `max_iterations_per_gate`, the epic pauses and waits for `/harness-on --epic --resume`.

Phase 2 will add `"skip"` and `"abort"`.

### Observability

Per-story toasts:

```
🚀 Epic "EPIC-24" started: 5 stories. First: "STORY-24-0".
✅ Story "STORY-24-2" done → next "STORY-24-3" (3/5)
⏸️ Story "STORY-24-2" PAUSED at gate "pre-merge". Use /harness-on --epic --resume after fix.
🏆 Epic "EPIC-24" complete! 5/5 stories done.
```

Full audit trail in `state.loop.epic.story_progress` array (state file).

## Gate Instructions Config

The `gate_instructions` field maps each gate name to a doc path and optional skill list. The plugin reads the doc at loop start and prepends it to the agent's context for that gate.

```json
{
  "gate_instructions": {
    "pre-merge": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/pre-merge.md",
      "skills": ["review-work", "code-review"]
    },
    "smoke-e2e": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/smoke-e2e.md"
    },
    "post-merge": {
      "skills": ["git-master"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`doc` + `skills`** — explicit doc injected, plus named skills loaded.
- **`doc` only** — doc injected; no extra skills.
- **`skills` only (no `doc`)** — skills loaded; plugin falls back to `docs/harness/gates/<gate>.md` by convention. A warning is logged if that file doesn't exist.

When `doc` is omitted entirely, the convention path is tried silently.

## Authoring Gate Instruction Docs

Gate instruction docs tell the agent exactly what to do for each gate. Use this structure:

```markdown
## Hard Rules
- <rule that must never be violated>

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. <first action>
2. <second action>

## Evidence Requirements
- Paste output of: <command>

## FAIL Conditions
- <condition that causes an automatic FAIL>
```

Example (`docs/harness/gates/smoke-e2e.md`):

```markdown
## Hard Rules
- Never claim smoke:e2e passes without showing actual curl output.

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Build: `go build -o ./bin/nano-brain ./cmd/nano-brain/`
2. Start server on port 3199
3. Wait for GET /health → `{"ready":true}`
4. Exercise changed endpoints with curl
5. Kill the server

## Evidence Requirements
- Paste all curl commands and responses in the PR description.

## FAIL Conditions
- Server fails to start
- Any curl returns non-2xx
- Response JSON is missing required fields
```

## Strict vs Flexible Mode

Set `strict_instructions: true` in `harness.config.json` to require every gate to have an instruction doc before the loop starts:

```json
{
  "strict_instructions": true
}
```

With `strict_instructions: true`, `/harness-on` refuses to start and prints a list of gates missing docs. Fix by adding a `doc` path to `gate_instructions` or creating the convention path file.

The default (`false`) warns about missing docs but continues. Useful when adopting the plugin incrementally.

## Async Gate Semantics

Use `async: true` for gates that depend on external systems where the result isn't available immediately (CI pipelines, npm publish, deploy health checks).

```json
{
  "gate_instructions": {
    "post-merge-release": {
      "doc": "docs/harness/gates/post-merge-release.md",
      "async": true,
      "async_max_wait_seconds": 1800,
      "async_poll_interval_seconds": 60,
      "async_subagent_type": "explore"
    }
  }
}
```

**`async_max_wait_seconds`** — size this at 2-3x your expected CI or deploy time. A release workflow that normally takes 8 minutes should get at least 1800 seconds (30 min) to account for queue delays.

**`async_subagent_type`** — controls which subagent polls the external system. Use `"explore"` for read-only checks (gh CLI, curl). Use `"hephaestus"` when the polling subagent may need to take corrective action.

**Heartbeat toasts** — while waiting, the plugin emits a toast every `async_poll_interval_seconds`: `"⏳ Waiting for post-merge-release (elapsed: 2m30s / max: 30m)"`. These are visible in the OpenCode status bar.

When `async_max_wait_seconds` expires without a terminal result, the gate emits `FAIL` with `instructions_for_agent` set to the timeout message.

## Writing an Async-Aware Runner

For async gates, your runner returns `WAITING` when the external system hasn't settled yet. The plugin re-polls after `wait_seconds`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/harness-check.sh post-merge-release --json

status=$(gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1 --json status --jq '.[0].status')

if [[ "$status" == "in_progress" || "$status" == "queued" ]]; then
  # Not done yet — tell the plugin to wait 60 seconds and re-poll
  echo '{"gate":"post-merge-release","status":"WAITING","checks":[],"wait_seconds":60}'
  exit 3
fi

conclusion=$(gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1 --json conclusion --jq '.[0].conclusion')

if [[ "$conclusion" == "success" ]]; then
  echo '{"gate":"post-merge-release","status":"PASS","checks":[],"next_gate":null}'
  exit 0
else
  echo "{\"gate\":\"post-merge-release\",\"status\":\"FAIL\",\"checks\":[],\"instructions_for_agent\":\"Release workflow failed with conclusion: $conclusion. Check the workflow logs.\"}"
  exit 1
fi
```

Key points:
- Exit code `3` signals `WAITING` to the plugin.
- `wait_seconds` in the JSON body overrides `async_poll_interval_seconds` for that specific poll cycle.
- Terminal statuses (`PASS`, `FAIL`, `SKIP`, `BLOCKED`, `ERROR`) use exit codes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 respectively.
